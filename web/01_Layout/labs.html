                <p>HTML and CSS are pretty straight-forward and easy languages to learn. There are plenty of resources on the web to use which makes the learning much easer.</p>
                <p>The advanced CSS techniques that I employed in this lab are <i>rounded-corners</i> and <i>box-shadows.</i> I used both of these techniques on the image of Kampala in my Home (index) page.</p>
                <p>The new thing that I learned in this lab is how to use AngularJS to simply implement code from a file instead of retyping/ copying and pasting it in every single file. This makes it much easier to implement a template for the website.</p>
